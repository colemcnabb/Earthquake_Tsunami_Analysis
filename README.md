# Earthquake and Tsunami Analysis

## Overview

- This project cleans and analyzes NOAA earthquake and tsunami data (1950-2025) to uncover long-term trends in frequency, geography, and human impact. Separate workflows for each disaster ensure clear, focused insights.

## Key Insights

1. **Earthquake Analysis**:
    - Reports rise post-1950, likely due to improved detection, especially in the last two decades.
    - Major earthquakes (â‰¥7.0 magnitude) average higher casualties, yet several moderate events rank among the deadliest due to population density. 
    - The deadliest earthquakes were not always the strongest in magnitude, emphasizing the importance of infrastructure and preparedness.

2. **Tsunami Analysis**:
    - Event frequency fluctuates, with more recorded tsunamis in recent decades.
    - A handful of catastrophic incidents account for most tsunami-related casualties.
    - March and July show noticeable spikes in recorded tsunamis, hinting at seasonal drivers.
